django_site
===========

playing around with django to try and implement some of my music website ideas 
goal is to get some analytics with various apis so people can tell how much they listen to various artists
first want to get a list of artists and their respective links, or at least a way to display them
then want to implement youtube api, then soundcloud, 
eventually want to provide a way for artists to virtually busk
